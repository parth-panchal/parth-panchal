### Hi, I'm Parth! ðŸ‘‹

*I'm an upcoming computer science engineering graduate, trying to learn something new everyday.*

I am currently increasing my skillset in the field of Data Science and full-stack development, along with contributing to open-source projects as much as I can. I am also exploring and learning more about REST APIs.
